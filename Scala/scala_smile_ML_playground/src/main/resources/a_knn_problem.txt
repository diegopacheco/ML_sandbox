Labeling ISPs based on their down/upload speed (K-NN using Smile in Scala)

The goal of this section is to use the K-Nearest Neighbours (K-NN) Algorithm to classify download/upload speed 
pairs as internet service provider (ISP) Alpha (represented by 0) or Beta (represented by 1). 

The idea behind K-NN is as follows: given a set of points that are classified, you can classify 
the new point by looking at its K neighbours (K being a positive integer). 

The idea is that you find the K-neighbours by looking at the euclidean distance between 
the new point and its surrounding points. For these neighbours you then look at the biggest 
representative class and assign that class to the new point.
